Introduction
The Integrated Smart Home System is a comprehensive Arduino-based project that combines three critical subsystems: a Home Security and Fire Detection System, a Rainwater Harvesting System, and a Motion-Activated Smart Lighting System. By integrating these functionalities into a single microcontroller, the system optimizes resource usage, enhances home safety, promotes sustainability, and reduces energy consumption. It features real-time monitoring via a serial interface and intelligent cross-system interactions, such as automatic door unlocking during fire emergencies.

Features

üîí Home Security and Fire Detection

Detects unauthorized entry using ultrasonic and IR sensors with debounced sensing to prevent false alarms.
Implements password-protected access with multiple authorized user codes.
Monitors for fire hazards with a flame sensor, triggering alarms and emergency door unlocking.
Uses servo motors for smooth door locking/unlocking with visual feedback via LEDs.


üíß Rainwater Harvesting

Automatically collects rainwater based on analog rain sensor readings and adaptive thresholds.
Manages tank capacity with a water level sensor to prevent overflow.
Controls a servo-driven valve to open/close based on rainfall and tank status.
Provides real-time status updates via serial output.


üí° Motion-Activated Smart Lighting

Activates lighting based on motion detection using an ultrasonic sensor.
Implements a timeout mechanism to turn off lights when no motion is detected, saving energy.
Supports manual override commands via serial input for testing and control.


üîÑ Non-Blocking Design

All subsystems operate concurrently without delays, ensuring smooth performance.
Shared hardware resources reduce costs and complexity.
Serial interface provides detailed debugging and status updates for all systems.


üõ† Hardware Efficiency

Utilizes a single Arduino board (e.g., Uno or Mega) to manage multiple subsystems.
Employs minimal components, including sensors, servos, LEDs, and a buzzer, connected via a breadboard.
